            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Dearly Beloved</hi> SONS, <hi>and most Humble</hi> Lords.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE Greet you well, and send you our <hi>Apostolick</hi> Benediction, and Condole with you for the loss of our Noble Son, and Heroick Champion, the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> who is now a most Glorious Saint in Heaven, and dwells among the most blessed Martyrs, and we are also willing that his <hi>Cannonization</hi> be also here on Earth, at half Fees; for you must know, that according to the Fundamental <hi>Maxim</hi> of this our Court, <hi>Earthly Advantage must be made by Heavenly Preferment:</hi> For it is fit that those who serve the <hi>Alter,</hi> must live by the <hi>Altar:</hi> And it should be an unpresidented Example, not to be found in all the Holy Acts of our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and would be a most scandalous Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Example to our Successors, should we deviate any ways from that Fundamental <hi>Maxim,</hi> as the Old Proverb has it, <hi>No Money no Pater-Noster;</hi> which, as it holds true in saying of Prayers, so also in us, for we ought not to be the Father of <hi>Poverty,</hi> and to bring our <hi>See</hi> to <hi>Beggery:</hi> for though we Write our selves <hi>Servus Servorum,</hi> a Servant of Servants, 'tis mystically meant, of such as serve us with their Purses: but truly our most Glorious Name is not <hi>Papa</hi> Father, but <hi>Piscator</hi> the Fisher, for we Hook in all we can, and have pretty well filled our Nets, as appears most intelligibly by the Fishers, or St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. We have filled our <hi>Calender</hi> with Saints, having two or three for every day of the year: we have filled <hi>Heaven</hi> with Martyrs, we have filled our <hi>Coffers</hi> with <hi>Coyn,</hi> and the <hi>Christian</hi> world with our Terror, Fame, and Authority; and we have filled <hi>Purgatory</hi> with Souls, and <hi>Hell</hi> with Excommunicated <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> so that we have well used our Talent left to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to become <hi>Fishers</hi> of Men, and of what belongs to them.</p>
            <p>Do not wonder my dear Sons, that we cause our Secretary to Write thus plainly to you, and not in our wonted Stile, full of the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Subtilties of this more Wise than Holy Court; for as <hi>Infallibility</hi> is an Inseperable Adjunct to us, and to our Holy <hi>Chair,</hi> so we know that we do not Err, and in that, we would you to understand by this our minds plainly, that as it is a most glorious preferment to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Cannonization</hi> of being a <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> here by us on earth, and adds (no doubt) much to the Glory and preferment of the party in Heaven, so it is most convenient, that our <hi>Maxim</hi> should be here maintained, that our Authority be still unbroken; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to come to our Application, my dearly beloved Sons, we advise you, if you shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the aforesaid Glorious Exaltation, that before you depart this Life, you take care for the procuring the Sum, according to our Book of Rates, which our Sons the <hi>Priests,</hi> or of the holy Order of <hi>Jesus</hi> can shew you, and you shall no sooner have caused it to be Remitted hither, but you shall find the benefit in <hi>Heaven,</hi> being there Exalted among the <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for we have not only St. <hi>Peters</hi> Keys to let in and shut out, whom we please, but also to advance or debase as we see convenint, both in Heaven and in Earth. It was for want of this necessary fulfilling of our <hi>Maxim, That this Wise Court must do nothing for nought;</hi> that our Son <hi>Coleman,</hi> nor others, have not yet obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:101640:2"/>this Exaltation, tho' the Charges of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Priest</hi> or an ordinary man a <hi>Saint,</hi> be much less than to make a Lord or a <hi>Prince;</hi> and good reason, they being better able to pay, and are more rarely found now adays: And your <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth lost the preferment through the Covetousness of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th.</p>
            <p>We have condoled the loss of our dear Son the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and we have caused <hi>Zachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> to be Sung thorow all our Churches, and have imposed a general <hi>Fast</hi> from Pullets and White Broth, thorow the whole City, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the greatness of our fatherly sorrow, and our selves have abstained one whole Meal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Sweet-meats, to bewail in private, the loss of that Noble Lord and Martyr. All this we have done for your Incouragement, that you may like Men quit your selves, when you shall come to the <hi>Scafford,</hi> and keep the same road of Innocency as your <hi>predecessors</hi> has done, that you may only <hi>Confess</hi> to your <hi>Priest,</hi> and dye <hi>Confirming,</hi> and strengthning the Holy <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith,</hi> that there is no Horrid Plot in <hi>England,</hi> to take away the <hi>Kings Life,</hi> and to set up <hi>our Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We further have you to wit, That it is our pleasure, that you be no ways Discouraged at the loss of our late <hi>Dearly beloved Son,</hi> and that his Death may not shake you, or the Dreadful name of an <hi>English-Parliament,</hi> for we would incourage your hopes by our <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Spirit,</hi> which still attends on our <hi>Holy See,</hi> that you shall be yet safe, if our Design shall succeed, which we do Assure you, by the <hi>Indifatigable Industry</hi> of our Pious Sons the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> is yet carrying on, and as we dayly understand from them, is yet in a fair way to perfection, for they have assured us of undoubted Hopes, of <hi>Dissolving</hi> your dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Parliament,</hi> by which you may get respite, for in the <hi>Interim,</hi> it will be their <hi>main Business</hi> and care, to highten the fends, jealousies and fears, already sowed among the People, and to widen the breaches of Factions and parties, that all may break forth into a Flame and Combustion, and then we doubt not to make our Harvest: Be, I say, therefore of good Courage and Resolution, and be not affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the long-Tail'd <hi>Comet,</hi> nor believe the foolish vulgar, who would have it to Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our <hi>Downfall;</hi> but I have consulted a wise <hi>Astrologer,</hi> and my own <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it signifies, besides the spoyling the King of <hi>France</hi> his <hi>Ballad,</hi> and the Death of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oved <hi>Monkie,</hi> the full extirpation of all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And lastly, <hi>Dear Sons,</hi> we would not have you any ways Discouraged, tho' the <hi>Ghost</hi> of our late Son the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> should Appear to you, with, or without his Head, and should tell you Stories of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and should tell you things like Truth, and Advise you to <hi>Confess</hi> and <hi>Repent,</hi> or at the Relation of any other foolish Apparitions, for we do Assure you by our <hi>Infallible Knowledge,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by certain News returned by our several Grand <hi>Curriers,</hi> from <hi>Hell, Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> which go and return every Twenty-Four Hours, that he is now in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that the Keeper of the Registers both of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> have sent me Word, <hi>No such Lord has arrived there this Seven Years:</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> sent me Word, <hi>That he had by our Order sent him by our Grand Currier, admitted the said Lord</hi> Stafford <hi>some few Moments after his Decollation, and that he stayed not the saying of Six</hi> Ave-Maries, <hi>and one</hi> Pater-Noster, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he let him in, and bad him Welcome.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I say, all those Ghosts and Apparitions, are all Lyes and false Illusions, raised by the <hi>Hereticks</hi> and their Assistant the <hi>Devil,</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you into <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Confession</hi> of the Plot; But, I say, beware of that, lest you go directly to <hi>Hell,</hi> instead of going to <hi>Heaven,</hi> for since I have the Keys of both in <hi>my Hands,</hi> and that the Keepers of the Gates of both Countreys, obey my Orders, you had better trust to me, who can infallibly Assure you of Salvation, let the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> say what they will.</p>
